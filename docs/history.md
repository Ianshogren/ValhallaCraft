# History of Our World

## The Three Kingdoms: A Legacy of Survival

We are the survivors, the remnants of a world that once was. Our journey began with the establishment of the Three Kingdoms, each one a pillar of support for the others. In a world constantly changing, we found strength in unity, resilience, and the collective will to thrive.

## The Changing Worlds Theory

The world as we knew it was not static. Artemis, a brilliant mind from our ranks, discovered the Changing Worlds Theory. This groundbreaking revelation unveiled that we were not merely dumped into a new world unprepared; instead, it was a fresh start, a new beginning with untapped potential.

## The Struggle for Survival

Our initial exploration was fraught with peril. Exposure to the harsh elements nearly claimed our lives. Yet, amidst the struggle, we discovered a world where survival was possible. This discovery marked a turning point, leading to the integration of MajorAxle, a key figure who brought invaluable knowledge and strength to our community.

## New Alliances

As we adapted to our new environment, two new survivors made contact. Their arrival signaled the opening of portals to old worlds, a bridge connecting our past with our present. These portals became conduits for knowledge, resources, and alliances, further solidifying our ability to thrive.

## The Incursion

However, our journey was not without its trials. The incursion marked a dark chapter in our history. An unexpected invasion tested our defenses and unity. But from this adversity, we emerged stronger, more determined to protect our newfound home.

## New Discoveries

In the aftermath of the incursion, a new survivor was found. This individual brought fresh perspectives and skills, contributing to our ever-evolving community. Together, we established a cottage along the north shore, a symbol of our resilience and adaptability.

## Establishing a Base

Our exploration and expansion continued, leading us to establish a base in the foothills of Minas Tirith. This strategic location provided us with a vantage point, allowing us to defend our territories and plan future endeavors.

## Conclusion

Our history is one of perseverance, adaptation, and growth. From the initial struggles of survival to the establishment of thriving communities, we have proven that unity and resilience are our greatest strengths. As we continue to explore and expand, the legacy of the Three Kingdoms will guide us towards a brighter future.

We are the survivors. We are the Three Kingdoms. And our journey is far from over.
